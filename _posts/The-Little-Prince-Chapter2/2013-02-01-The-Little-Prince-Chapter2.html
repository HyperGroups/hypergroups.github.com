 　　--- the narrator crashes in the desert and makes the acquaintance of the little prince　
</p>



<p class="Text">
 So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And <span style="font-weight: bold;">as I had with me</span> neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I <span style="font-weight: bold;">set myself to</span> attempt the difficult repairs all alone. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It was a question of life or death for me</span>: I had scarcely enough <span style="font-weight: bold;">drinking water</span> to last a week. 
</p>



<p class="Text">
 The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said: <br clear="none"/>"If you please-- draw me a sheep!" <br clear="none"/>"What!" <br clear="none"/>"Draw me a sheep!" 
</p>



<p class="Text">
 I <span style="font-weight: bold;">jumped to my feet</span>, completely <span style="font-weight: bold;">thunderstruck</span>. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Here you may see the best potrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model. </span>
</p>



<p class="Text">
 That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.<br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>Now I stared at this sudden <span class="SubsubsectionInline">apparition</span> with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be <span style="font-weight: bold;">straying</span> uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from <span style="font-weight: bold;">fatigue</span> or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: <br clear="none"/>"But-- what are you doing here?" <br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of <span style="font-weight: bold;">a matter of great consequence</span>: "If you please-- draw me a sheep..." <br clear="none"/>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket <span style="font-weight: bold;">a sheet of paper</span> and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little <span style="font-weight: bold;">crossly</span>, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me: <br clear="none"/>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..." <br clear="none"/><br clear="none"/>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, <br clear="none"/>"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very <span style="font-weight: bold;">cumbersome</span>. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep." <br clear="none"/>So then I made a drawing. <br clear="none"/>

 He looked at it carefully, then he said: <br clear="none"/>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another." <br clear="none"/>So I made another drawing.

 My friend smiled gently and indulgenty. <br clear="none"/>"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns." <br clear="none"/>So then I did my drawing over once more. <br clear="none"/>

 But it was rejected too, just like the others. <br clear="none"/>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time." <br clear="none"/>By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing. <br clear="none"/>
</p>



<p class="Text">
 And I threw out an explanation with it. <br clear="none"/>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."

 <br clear="none"/>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge: <br clear="none"/>"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?" <br clear="none"/>"Why?" <br clear="none"/>"Because where I live everything is very small..." <br clear="none"/>"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you." <br clear="none"/>He bent his head over the drawing: <br clear="none"/>"Not so small that-- Look! He has gone to sleep..." <br clear="none"/>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.&nbsp;
